## Description
This project is a unique and creative implementation of the classic "Snake" game using the Python programming language. Instead of relying on advanced graphics, I've taken an unconventional approach: using only text strings to represent and update the game!

### Key Features
* String Manipulation: Rather than using traditional graphics, the game is designed to employ text string manipulation. Each game element, including the snake, food, and game board, is represented using characters and plain text.

* Adjustable Board Size: Customize your gameplay experience by modifying the size of the game board. Increase the challenge by shrinking the board or create a more leisurely game by expanding it.

* Dynamic Speed Increase: With every 5 points you score, the game's speed will progressively increase, keeping you on your toes and providing an ever-evolving challenge.

* Keyboard Detection and Speed Boost: Navigate the snake using keyboard arrow keys. Additionally, you have the ability to boost the game's speed with a designated button, adding an extra layer of control to your gameplay.

* Tkinter and Threading: To achieve smooth interaction and an enjoyable user experience, I've integrated the Tkinter library for the graphical interface. Additionally, I've implemented threading to handle background game updates and prevent blocking.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project was to elevate programming skills and creativity. Through this implementation, I aimed to provide developers with an opportunity to deeply explore the use of string manipulation, integration of graphical interfaces with Tkinter, and management of multiple threads using threading in Python.

### Some of the secondary objectives include:

* Learning how to represent game elements using characters and text.
* Getting familiar with the Tkinter library and its integration in desktop applications.
* Practicing thread handling for smooth and seamless interaction.

### Execution Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MaickMos/Game_Snake_Just_String.git
   ```
3. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.7 or higher).
4. Run the Snake.py file to start the game.
